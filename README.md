# Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project implements a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to classify text sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) from user reviews or social media data. The focus is on text preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning model development for real-world sentiment prediction.

## Features
- Text preprocessing: tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF and Bag-of-Words
- Model training: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest
- Model evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Fully implemented in Google Colab

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NLTK, SpaCy
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab
- GitHub
