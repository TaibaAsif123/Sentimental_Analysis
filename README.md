# Sentimental Analysis

## Project Overview
This project implements a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to analyze and classify text sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) from user reviews, social media posts, or other textual data. The project demonstrates text preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning model training to predict sentiment accurately.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization
- **Feature Extraction:** TF-IDF and Bag-of-Words representations
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest
- **Model Evaluation:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- **Platform:** Fully implemented in Google Colab

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NLTK, SpaCy
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab
- GitHub
